I have had multiple people test out multiple scenarios with my Pet Plus Vet website

• User discovered that email links did not works
• User discovered that entering just city name did not give pet results. I changed it so that entering city name AND state is required
• User suggested adding website name to logo
• User discovered that some descriptions for pets were "undefined"
