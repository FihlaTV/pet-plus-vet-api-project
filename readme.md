Pet Plus Vet is a tool where a user can search for adoptable pets and vets in their area. There's a saying that goes "if you can't afford the vet don't adopt the pet." The goal of this website is to drive home the importance of animal health care when adding a new member (pet) to your family.

This website was made possible by using data pulled from two third party APIs. http://petfinder.com and http://maps.googlevet.com (Google Maps Javascript API)
